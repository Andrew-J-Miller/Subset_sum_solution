# Subset_sum_solution


This repository contains a python 3.6 solution for the subset sum problem, which was originally a group project for CSC 3430, an algorithims course at Seattle Pacific University.

The python script uses dynamic programming to achieve a psuedo polynomial runtime. For further information, refer to PDF included.
